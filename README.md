<p># Finite-State-Machine-Minimization Java</p>
<p>According to the text file (example input.txt) the minimization algorithm is produced.
First, a transition map is created for the file, unreachable states (zero step) are removed using a depth-first search, unremoved states are grouped in stages, and finally a map is formed according to which the states are combined and a minimal graph is obtained. (which can be written to a file or output to the console)</p>
